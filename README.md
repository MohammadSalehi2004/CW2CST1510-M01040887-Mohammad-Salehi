Course: CST1510 -CW2 - Multi-Domain Intelligence Platform

## Project Description
A command-line authentication system implementing secure password hashing
This system allows users to register accounts and log in with proper pass
## Features
- Secure password hashing using bcrypt with automatic salt generation
- User registration with duplicate username prevention
- User login with password verification
- Input validation for usernames and passwords
- File-based user data persistence
## Technical Implementation
- Hashing Algorithm: bcrypt with automatic salting
- Data Storage: Plain text file (`users.txt`) with comma-separated values
- Password Security: One-way hashing, no plaintext storage
- Validation: Username (3-20 alphanumeric characters), Password (6-50 char)

## Project Description
This is a README file and an instruction on how to run the CW2 files from week 8 to 10
## Instructions
- First make sure all the files are corectly located as my github, which is the same structure given in week 8
- after that run main.py( in terminal enter " python main.py ") or get straight into streamlit, running main.py will reset the rows as csv files
- after that run the homepage for the app which is Home.py (run it how you wish just make sure the streamlit run command ends with the file name and .py)
- everything should be working if the steps are followed and user can register and select their role depending on how much access they wish for
- for the week 11 files user must follow the same instructions, make sure the file is in the right place and then open the Home.py page
## Technical Implementation
- At the end some small things were added to beautify using emojis and basic success messages that turn green, adding banners on top of home page and dahboards was an option too but I prefer this look.
